# Chef Recipes

A *recipe* is a file that contains *Chef* code. 

### Chef Code in a Ruby DSL

Chef code is written in a domain-specific language written in the Ruby programming language. 

It offers expression that are more tailored for the system administration tasks. 
The DSL is designed to allow the machines to be configured by programming declaratively rather than programming procedurally/imperatively.
The focus is on describing *what* the configuration is, rather than *how* the configuration can be accomplished.
